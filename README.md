# Landing-Page
Create/Revise landing page to update and control the page to create a dynamic user experience.
## Instructions

The starter code has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

## Loading the Web Page
To get the page running you'll need to start the Node server by typing an npm command in the terminal:
```
npm start
```

To see the web page, you'll need to click the ***VIEW THE WEB PAGE*** button at the bottom of the screen.

That will open a new browser tab that contains the replica web page.  The page will update as you make changes.

## Tips for Using the Workspace

1. Expand the workspace to full screen. That will give you more room to work.
2. If the type in the workspace is too small, use your browser's zoom control to magnify the screen.
3. You can upload files to the workspace by dragging and dropping them into the workspace window.
4. You can download files from the workspace by right-clicking on the file in the ***Explorer*** panel and selecting ***Download***.
